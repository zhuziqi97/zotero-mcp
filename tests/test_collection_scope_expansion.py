"""Collection scoping in `get_items_with_text`.

`semantic_search.collection_keys` restricts indexing to the configured
collections plus everything nested beneath them, resolved by walking
`collections.parentCollectionID` in `local_db.py`. That walk had no test
coverage at all, so most of what follows pins existing behaviour rather than
new behaviour: nesting is followed to any depth, siblings are excluded,
unknown keys are ignored.

The one behaviour change is that the walk now remembers which collections it
has already visited. A `parentCollection` cycle previously made it loop
forever, and configuring both a collection and one of its ancestors bound the
same collectionID as several SQL parameters.
