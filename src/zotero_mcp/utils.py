    same repair a library ends up shouting.

    Only wholly-uppercase or wholly-lowercase words are touched, which is

    Takes and returns whatever it is given: the original guards against an
    absent given name, and mirroring that keeps a missing field missing
    rather than turning it into ``"None"``.

    One deliberate divergence. The original upper-cases the character
    *before* the letter as well, so it maps symbols that happen to carry
    case -- "x(circled a)y" becomes "X(circled A)Y" there and keeps the
