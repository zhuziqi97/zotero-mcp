        ``ChromaClient.update_metadatas()`` — metadata-only, so no

        Attribution is strictly evidence-based, because the deletion pass is
        scoped by ``group_id`` and a guessed tag is a future deletion

        1. ``LocalZoteroReader.get_key_group_map()`` (local mode): ground
           truth from the live database, trashed items included so trash is
           attributed to its true library.
        2. Membership in the active library's ``item_versions()`` — fetched
           lazily, at most once per run. In local mode this also covers
           WAL-fresh items the immutable sqlite read cannot see (#292); a
           fetch failure propagates so the caller retries next update rather
           than tagging by guesswork.
        3. No evidence → left untagged and counted. Untagged docs are
           excluded from library-filtered search and can never match the
           deletion pass's ``group_id`` filter.

        Idempotent: docs that already carry ``group_id`` are left untouched,
        so a partial/interrupted run just resumes on the next call.

            include_fulltext: Whether to fetch server-side extracted

                `semantic_search.include_fulltext` config setting (True
                unless explicitly disabled). Ignored in local mode since
                `extract_fulltext` provides richer local extraction.
            use_openai_batch: Deprecated in favour of `use_batch` /
                `batch_provider`. Override for OpenAI Batch API indexing.
                None uses `semantic_search.openai_batch.enabled`. Ignored

                `batch_provider`. Override for Gemini Batch API indexing.
                None uses `semantic_search.gemini_batch.enabled`.
            use_batch: Provider-neutral on/off for Batch API indexing; the
                provider is inferred from the configured embedding model
                unless `batch_provider` names one.
            batch_provider: Which batch provider to use. Must match the
                configured embedding model.
            batch_max_tokens: Override for the enqueued-token throttle
                (`semantic_search.<provider>_batch.batch_max_enqueued_tokens`).
            batch_max_requests: Override for the per-file request cap
                (`semantic_search.<provider>_batch.batch_max_requests`).
            auto_loop: After submitting, keep polling, importing completed
                batches and submitting parked ones until the run finishes.
            batch_poll_interval: Seconds between auto-loop polls.
            allow_mass_deletion: One-run opt-in for a deletion pass that
                would remove a large share of the library's indexed docs
                (or all of them, when item_versions() reports the library

        metadata, splitting it into passages when chunking is on, truncating to

        and clearing an item's stale passages before its new ones are written.

        Safe to call from a worker thread. The assembly loop touches no shared

        ``_chroma_call_lock`` so they can never interleave with a commit
        running on another thread.
