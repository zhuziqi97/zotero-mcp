"""Provider-agnostic base classes for zotero-mcp's embedding functions.

Two classes live here. :class:`BaseEmbeddingFunction` is the minimal shared
surface every provider has, local ones included. :class:`RemoteEmbeddingFunction`
sits on top of it and adds what only an HTTP-backed provider needs: sub-batching,
optional parallelism across sub-batches, adaptive rate limiting and retries.
HuggingFace stays on the plain base — it runs a local model, so there is no
request to pace.

``BaseEmbeddingFunction`` holds the two method bodies that were already
byte-identical across the concrete providers when they lived in
``chroma_client.py``, plus ChromaDB's batch query entry point:

- ``embed_query_text`` -> ``self.__call__([text])[0]``, one query string to one
  vector. OpenAI, HuggingFace and Ollama each carried their own copy of exactly
  this. ``RemoteEmbeddingFunction`` overrides it to route the request through
  the limiter, and Gemini's query path differs from its document path — a
  different task type (v1), a different prompt prefix (v2) — which it expresses
  through ``_prepare_query``.
- ``embed_query``, which is ChromaDB's ``EmbeddingFunction`` protocol method:
  a sequence in, a list of vectors out, mapped onto ``embed_query_text``.
- a character-ratio ``truncate``. Gemini and Ollama each carried their own copy
  at 4 chars/token. OpenAI overrides it with tiktoken and HuggingFace with the
  model's own tokenizer.

Neither class is registered with ChromaDB — neither has ``name()``,
``get_config()`` or ``build_from_config()``, so neither can be resolved by
name when a persisted collection's config is rebuilt. Only the concrete
subclasses are registered.

``chars_per_token`` is read as a class attribute rather than an instance one on
purpose: several tests construct providers via ``Cls.__new__(Cls)``, setting
only the handful of instance attributes the assertion needs, so anything these
classes touch has to resolve without ``__init__`` having run. Every attribute
``RemoteEmbeddingFunction`` reads therefore goes through ``getattr(...,
default)``, and its rate limiter is built lazily on first use.
