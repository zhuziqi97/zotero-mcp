"""Optional tool groups ("toolsets") and the logic that decides which ship.

Every registered ``@mcp.tool`` is sent to the client on *every* request as
part of the tool list, so the tool surface is a fixed tax on each session's
context window. The full surface costs roughly 23k tokens; a reading or
literature-review session typically touches a small fraction of it.

This module carves the optional groups out of that surface. Anything not
named here is **core** and always available, so merging or renaming a core
tool never requires touching this file. Only the opt-in groups are
enumerated, and :func:`validate_toolsets` (exercised by the test suite)
fails loudly if a name here ever drifts from the real tool registry —
FastMCP silently ignores unknown names, so drift is otherwise invisible.

Selection happens through the ``ZOTERO_MCP_TOOLSETS`` environment variable:

===========================  ==================================================
Value                        Effect
===========================  ==================================================
unset                        Core plus :data:`DEFAULT_ON` (the default profile)
``all``                      Every tool, matching pre-0.9 behaviour
``none``                     Core only
``scite,feeds``              Core plus the named groups
``all,-scite``               Every group except the negated ones
===========================  ==================================================

Names are case-insensitive and may be separated by commas or whitespace.
