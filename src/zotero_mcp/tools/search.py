    Perform an advanced search with multiple criteria.

    Args:
        conditions: List of search condition dictionaries, each containing:
                   - field: The field to search (title, creator, date, tag, etc.)
                   - operation: The operation to perform (is, isNot, contains, etc.)
                   - value: The value to search for
        join_mode: Whether all conditions must match ("all") or any condition can match ("any")
        sort_by: Field to sort by (dateAdded, dateModified, title, creator, etc.)
        sort_direction: Direction to sort (asc or desc)
        limit: Maximum number of results to return
        include_subcollections: Make a `collection` condition match items filed
            anywhere in that collection's subtree rather than in it directly.
            Applies to the `is` and `isNot` operations, which are the
            membership questions; other operators keep comparing keys as
            before. Defaults to False, matching Zotero's own "Search
            subcollections" checkbox.
        search_all_libraries: Search every accessible library at once instead
            of the active one (#163). Requires the SQLite backend; each result
            is labelled with its source library. A `collection` condition is
            rejected in this mode — collection keys are per-library — while
            `tag` conditions work, since Zotero stores tags in one
            database-wide table shared by every library.

    Get semantic search database status.

    path below also avoids constructing the embedding function, which for the
