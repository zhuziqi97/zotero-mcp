       name matches anywhere in the tree and 'parent/name' disambiguates
       same-named leaves.

    spec raises ValueError with near-miss suggestions — unless

    Zotero's quick search splits the query on whitespace and requires EVERY
    token to match (measured: reordering the words of a title still finds
    it, appending one junk word drops it to zero hits). That makes the
    fallback query only as good as the title handed to it, and a title
    arrives in the shape its *source* stores it, not the shape Zotero does.
    A real ``<i>``, ``<sub>`` or ``&amp;`` in the query is a token that
    matches nothing, so one italicised species name takes the whole lookup
    to zero against an item whose stored title is clean. Tags are therefore
    removed and entities resolved before the query is built.

    A tag is replaced by a space, not deleted, because Zotero may have
    stored the title with its markup or without it, and every token has to
    occur in either. Deleting the tags in ``DREAM<sub>(D)</sub>:`` glues
    ``DREAM(D):`` into one token, and measured against the Web API that
    finds nothing for an item stored with the ``<sub>`` still in place.
    Splitting there leaves ``DREAM``, ``(D)`` and ``:``, which occur in both.

    The DOI path's title has already been through
    ``utils.strip_unsupported_markup`` and ``utils.repair_crossref_string``,
    and neither makes it a search key. The first deliberately keeps the
    markup Zotero renders — ``<i>``, ``<b>``, ``<sub>``, ``<sup>``, and small
    caps as a styled ``<span>`` — which is exactly the markup that zeroes a
    query. The second repairs CrossRef deposits, and deletes newlines
    outright where a query wants them as spaces. Titles from arXiv, Open
    Library, a landing page or a BibTeX/CSL-JSON entry pass through neither.

    Runs of whitespace are collapsed as well. That one is free rather than
    load-bearing — quick search tokenizes, so it already ignores them — but
    arXiv's wrapped Atom titles reach us full of them and a query string
    that reads like the title it is searching for is easier to debug.

    Exactly one of doi / arxiv_id / isbn / url should be given (already
    normalized via the corresponding ``_normalize_*`` helper, except url).
    ``title`` is optional and additive: see below.

    A server-side quick search narrows candidates cheaply; a client-side
    normalized comparison confirms real matches. The items endpoint excludes
    the Trash, so a trashed copy never blocks a re-add.

    **The identifier query alone cannot be relied on.** Zotero's ``q``
    parameter "searches titles and individual creator fields", and the API
    documentation notes that "searching of other fields will be possible in
    the future" — so DOI, url, archiveID and extra are NOT searchable server
    side. Against the Web API an identifier query therefore returns zero
    candidates for an item that IS present, the caller reads that as "not in
    the library", and ``if_exists='file'`` creates a duplicate.

    So when ``title`` is given and the identifier query confirms nothing, a
    second pass queries the title — which the API does index — and runs the
    same identifier comparison over those candidates. The identifier still
    decides, so this widens the net without loosening the test: a
    same-title-different-paper is rejected exactly as before. Callers that
    have already fetched metadata should pass it.

    Be clear about what that costs. Because the identifier query almost
    never matches against the Web API, "only on a miss" means "on nearly
    every call": passing a title should be expected to cost two searches per
    check, not one. It is still worth keeping the identifier query in front
    rather than skipping it when a title is available, because the two cover
    different things — ``qmode='everything'`` also searches child-attachment
    full text, where a paper's own DOI genuinely does appear, and it finds an
    item stored under a title that no longer matches the one just fetched.
    The title query cannot do either.

    Returns full item dicts (with ``key``/``version``/``data``) so callers
    can update them without re-fetching. Returns [] on search failure —
    callers treat that as "nothing found" and proceed to create — except when
    Zotero rate-limited the search, which propagates rather than masquerading
    as "nothing found" and duplicating an item that exists.
