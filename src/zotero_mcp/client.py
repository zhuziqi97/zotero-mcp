    ``in_place=True`` returns a file already in local storage by its own path
    instead of copying it. Only for callers that read the file and never
    modify or delete it; anything else must take the copy (#372).

    The fallback order is:
    1. local Zotero storage, resolved straight off the local SQLite DB
    2. local Zotero API (works with local storage or desktop-managed WebDAV)
    3. Direct WebDAV access via environment variables
    4. Zotero Web API (works with Zotero cloud storage)

    Step 1 exists because none of the later steps can serve a *linked* file.
    The local API answers ``/file`` for a linked attachment with a 302 to a
    ``file://`` URL, which httpx refuses to follow ("unsupported protocol"),
    and a linked file is by definition never uploaded to WebDAV or Zotero
    storage — so all three remaining sources fail on an attachment that is
    sitting readable on the same disk. Reading the path out of the DB avoids
    the redirect entirely and is faster for ordinary stored files too.
